## 🎯 Three-Phase Tournament Structure

### **Phase 1: Group Stage**
```
📊 Round-Robin Within Groups
• Snake-draft seeding (1→A, 2→B, 3→C, 4→D, 5→D, 6→C...)
• Configurable scoring (2-1-0 default) 
• Full tiebreaker hierarchy
• Every team guaranteed multiple games
```

### **Phase 2: Tier Classification**
```
🎯 Performance-Based Sorting
• Pro Tier: 1st place teams from each group
• Intermediate Tier: 2nd & 3rd place teams
• Novice Tier: 4th place teams
• Automatic elimination of excess teams (lowest-ranked)
```

### **Phase 3: Tiered Playoffs**
```
🏆 Separate Elimination Brackets
• Pro Champion (highest skill level)
• Intermediate Champion (middle skill level)  
• Novice Champion (developing teams)
• Competitive balance guaranteed
```

## 📊 Example Tournament Structures

### 16 Teams → Perfect Structure
- **Groups**: 4 groups of 4 teams each
- **Eliminated**: 0 teams
- **Pro Tier**: 4 teams (1st place winners)
- **Intermediate Tier**: 8 teams (2nd & 3rd place)
- **Novice Tier**: 4 teams (4th place)
- **Games per Team**: 4-6 games

### 23 Teams → Smart Adaptation
- **Groups**: 7 groups of 3 teams each (21 usable)
- **Eliminated**: 2 lowest teams
- **Pro Tier**: 7 teams
- **Intermediate Tier**: 7 teams
- **Novice Tier**: 7 teams
- **Games per Team**: 3-5 games

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Tournament Groups Table
CREATE TABLE tournament_groups (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tournament_id UUID REFERENCES tournaments(id),
  group_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  group_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  team_ids TEXT[] NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Tournament Tiers Table  
CREATE TABLE tournament_tiers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tournament_id UUID REFERENCES tournaments(id),
  team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id),
  tier TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (tier IN ('pro', 'intermediate', 'novice')),
  group_position INTEGER NOT NULL,
  group_points INTEGER NOT NULL,
  point_differential INTEGER NOT NULL,
  tier_seed INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Algorithm Highlights
- **Snake-Draft Formula**: `round % 2 == 0 ? position : numGroups - 1 - position`
- **Optimal Group Size**: Prefers 4 teams per group, falls back to 3 if too many eliminations
- **Tiebreaker Priority**: Points → Point Differential → Points Scored → Win Percentage
- **Automatic Scaling**: Works efficiently from 8 to 32+ teams

## 🎮 User Experience Features

### Smart Format Selection
- **Contextual Help**: Help button appears when tiered format is selected
- **Format Preview**: Shows key features directly in the form
- **Interactive Demo**: Comprehensive explanation with examples
