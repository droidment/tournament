 Tournament Model Integration:
Should this be added as a new TournamentFormat enum value (e.g., TournamentFormat.tiered)?

Yes

Or should it use the existing TournamentFormat.custom with additional configuration?

NO

2. Scoring System:
You mention "2 points for win, 1 for tie, 0 for loss" - should this be configurable?
Yes, this should be configurable.

How do we handle sports that don't typically have ties?
Equal points?

3. UI/UX Flow:
Should there be a separate configuration dialog for setting up groups, tier distributions, etc.?
We need to enforce seeding for all teams and the seeds will be spread across the groups, 1 to the 1st group and so on and in the 4th group, 5th seed will be in it and i6th team to the 3rd group and so on.
How should we display the transition between phases to users?
We will probably need to have a PRO view, Internediate view and Novice View after the round robins are completed.
4. Database Schema:
Do we need new tables for groups, tier assignments, and multi-phase results?
Yes, New table are fine.

Should we extend existing models or create new ones?
5. Team Elimination:
When excess teams are eliminated (e.g., 3 teams from 23), should this be:
Automatic (lowest seed/random)? LOWEST ranked after the round robin

Manual selection by tournament organizer? NO
Based on some criteria? Lowest
6. Tiebreaker Implementation:
Should we implement the full tiebreaker hierarchy (points → head-to-head → point differential)?
Yes, please
What sport-specific tiebreakers should we support?
Volleyball: and Pickleball. But if you want to do only one sport, then Volleyball, it is.
