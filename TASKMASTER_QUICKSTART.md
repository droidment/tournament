# 🚀 TaskMaster AI Quick Start Guide

TaskMaster AI has been successfully initialized in your Flutter tournament management project!

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

- **MCP Configuration**: `.cursor/mcp.json` created for Cursor integration
- **Project Structure**: `.taskmaster/` directory with configuration files
- **PRD Document**: Comprehensive PRD created at `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`
- **Configuration**: Project settings configured for Flutter development
- **Templates**: Example templates for future reference

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Add Your API Keys (Required)

Edit `.cursor/mcp.json` and replace the placeholder API keys with your actual keys:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "taskmaster-ai": {
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-ant-api03-your-actual-key-here",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-your-actual-openai-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**You need at least ONE API key** from:
- Anthropic (Claude) - Recommended
- OpenAI (GPT models)
- Google (Gemini)
- Perplexity, xAI, Mistral, or OpenRouter

### 2. Enable TaskMaster in Cursor

1. Open Cursor Settings (`Ctrl+Shift+J`)
2. Click "MCP" tab on the left
3. Find "taskmaster-ai" and enable it
4. Restart Cursor

### 3. Initialize TaskMaster

In Cursor's AI chat, type:
```
Initialize taskmaster-ai in my project
```

### 4. Generate Your First Tasks

Once initialized, ask TaskMaster:
```
Parse my PRD at .taskmaster/docs/prd.txt and generate tasks
```

## 🎯 Common Commands

Once TaskMaster is running, you can use these commands in Cursor's AI chat:

```
# Get started
Parse my PRD and generate tasks

# Work on tasks
What's the next task I should work on?
Help me implement task 3
Expand task 5 into subtasks

# Track progress
